    <title>11 jan 2024 choosing "the unlicence" as a licence</title>
</head>
<body>
Attracted by $$$ and its function in buying other people's time, I was tempted to leave out the licence choice and keep copyrights -the rightful default.
However, for me this is strongly, in this particular/specific situation of "computer code", against my values and behaviour, and a misclick led me another time on the Unlicence as I was making the licence file, and it felt the most "open source" to me.
    
I don't care about ideology, neither am I against "the system" of which, like anybody else, I am kind of a product.
Changing oneself, fighting against our own flaws, recognising our mistakes and working on not repeating them, being honest and banishing lies of our mouths, not doing to others what we don't want  others to do to us: I think that's a better dedication of our time, this time, on earth.
I kinda saw some open-source ideologists trying to prevent big companies using their code, or carefully wording licences in the goal of restricting big companies.
But why?
Are they bad?
Apple bad? Microsoft bad? 
Remember we are all using military-grade, military-funded, military-invented encryption on armed-forces internet, think about it when you SHA something.            
A lot of the bad is relative, and military is neither good nor bad, it's a tool.
In my opinion, it's good. Makes boys men.
I digress, I think nothing is zero-sum. 
The animosity, the disdain, and the many **bugs that were actually features** in multiplaform apps for Mac, actually made me learn so many things.
Big projects leaving out Mac, least updated parts, most commits removing code in lieu of fixing things, the use of years old mac libraries, the contempt in wording and the general lack of desire to support Macs, was very frustrating.
I won't name, and once again, thanks to this, I am where I am, and I have seen in the past an arrogant pride in some Mac users, sure. 
We musn't forget tecnically we are all controlling pieces of flesh using lifeless machinery.
I use Mac, yes I think it's superior, but it surely is because I was born in it, playing Lemonade on Apple IIC and that Corporate game where you had yo buy shares or something.
But I also think it's very annoying.
What's up with the tens of thousands of log messages in so little time, in a so fresh install?
Why prevent the desactivation of uneeded things?
What's up with all those processes with all those weird names that aren't documentated? (There is even one named Pegasu, as far as I know, it's for iphone's picture in picture)
I would prefer to be able to have full control of my Mac, make it run the bare minimum to maximize performance.
But.
I digressed again.

To sum it up: 
Mac: you can only do what Apple say you can do, and and every so and so, there are new things you must do.
Windows: you can do everything, expect what we say you can't do, and sometimes we tell you to do something we said you can't do, so you can do something normal.
Linux; you can do anything you want, but it has to be complicated, in command line, and involve a new packet manager every so and so.

    
So yeah, do whatever you want with the code.
I came up with it reading documentation and googling error messages until it worked.
