So when the macbook air M2 came out, I eventually saw this offer on amazon and went "F it", and got the 8GB ram base model...
I whine about those 8GBs a lot because I believe I need a lot of RAM:
I run a lot of Chrome tabs.
I don't like to reboot.
I use machine learning and generative "ai" apps.
I can't stand waiting for an app to open.
Xcode is thus launched.
I use Apple remote desktop.
Excel...
No fancy background picture, and every options that I know of to reduce MacOS footprints (like no transparency effects)...

And then I thouht, "but how many tabs am I using anyway"?
I googled and if you go to "chrome://inspect/#pages" and do a search for "inspect", you can see the count.

742 tabs.

Obviously being ungrateful here.
It's cool, 8GB very cool.
8GB very fine for most user case.
Tests are done here but work is via ssh/ARD with brokenscreen 32gb M1max.
I have a more pleasant experience with the 8Gb M2 because its battery life is extraordinary, the M1max I had to use it in low power mode to increase battery life and it saddened me.
