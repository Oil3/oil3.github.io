| Modifier/Keyword | Description                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `private var`    | A variable that is accessible only within the scope of the enclosing declaration, such as a class or struct.                              |
| `fileprivate var`| A variable that is accessible within the same source file.                                                                                |
| `internal var`   | A variable that has internal access (default access level), meaning it's accessible within the same module.                               |
| `public var`     | A variable that is accessible from any file within the same module and from any module that imports the module where the variable is defined. |
| `open var`       | Similar to `public var`, but it also allows the variable to be overridden by subclasses outside the module.                              |
| `var`            | A variable that can be read and written to. It has internal access by default.                                                            |
| `let`            | A constant that is assigned a value only once and cannot be changed after it's set.                                                       |
| `weak var`       | A variable with a weak reference to an object. It's used to prevent strong reference cycles in closures and between class instances.     |
| `static var`     | A variable that is shared among all instances of a class or struct. It belongs to the type itself rather than any instance.               |
| `class var`      | Similar to `static var`, but it allows subclasses to override the variable's value.                                                      |


| Square symbol            | Description                                                                                                                       |

| `ðŸ‡² (Method)`      | Indicates a method or a function. Methods are functions associated with a specific class, structure, or enumeration.             |
| `ðŸ‡¨ (Class)`       | Represents a class. Classes are blueprint templates used to create instances of objects and can contain methods, properties, and initializers. |
| `ðŸ‡ª (Enum)`        | Indicates an enumeration type. Enumerations group related values and enable type-safe handling of those values.                  |
| `ðŸ‡¸ (Struct)`      | Represents a struct. Structs are similar to classes but are value types and do not support inheritance.                          |
| `ðŸ‡µ (Protocol)`    | Indicates a protocol. Protocols define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements for specific tasks or functionalities. |
| `ðŸ‡» (Variable)`    | Represents a variable or a property. Variables are storage locations for data, while properties are variables associated with classes, structures, or enumerations. |
| `ðŸ‡¹ (Type)`        | Used for type aliases and other type-related symbols. Type aliases define alternative names for existing types.                  |
| `ðŸ‡° (Keyword)`     | Indicates a language keyword (e.g., `if`, `while`, `return`). Keywords are reserved words in Swift with special meaning.         |
| `ðŸ‡¦ (Attribute)`   | Indicates an attribute (e.g., `@IBOutlet`, `@IBAction`). Attributes provide additional information about declarations or types.  |
| `# (Preprocessor Directive)` | Represents a preprocessor directive in C and C++ (e.g., `#define`, `#import`). Preprocessor directives give instructions to the compiler before compilation. |
