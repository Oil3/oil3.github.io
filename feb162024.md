How did I end up here?
I quote Rocco Gagliardi _"A Mac is a Mac and it works. In front of a Macbook Retina you feel comfortable, as long as youâ€™re in the OS X flow."_
But why though?
Because of the _ahurissante_ quantity of stuff like that, of finding something apparently useful, and then seeing MacOS left apart.

Lazy condescendent mofos. An another guy on another software responded to a bug report _as of today macos version .. is not not a supported platform anymore_ 

Oh I think I know Apple, I don't ever dare sending a feedback, like, I feel if a _client_ comes up with an idea then they won't do it. 
I mean. Apple. Back in 2015 or so we got the macbook 12 for my amazing woman of the moment. It had a motherboard the size of a RAM bar, beautiful, sufficiently powerful for her never complaining.
But.
One.
USB-C.
Port.
Just One.
The webcams. what's up with macbook's 480p and still now 720p? 

The unique usb-c bothered not for being single, but for being usb-c at a time where there were _no mucho_ usb-c.
The webcam, it's a bother for surveillance matters but that's about it, and personally, I taped mine.
I use my phone for video chat. Makes the mother happy. Yes it's an Iphone.
I refused to buy one until the 11 came out, before that, I thought it was overpriced for the actual hardware.
It is a fantastic piece of engineering for work because: dates, weekday, "tomorrow morning" kind of expressions, get underlined and you click on them and it automatically prefill a calendar event and it's just amazing, for me. I own and run 3 small restaurants and when I actually do what I'm supposed to do, that involve clicking to create a calendar event, _a lot_ 
The other thing, it's the "notes" app that has a very nice scan to pdf tools, very, very well made. It scans, and then in a minute or so if I open the same app on th mac, it's there. `
The quantity of bills/notes/payment slips and stuff that I need to send scanned is absurdly high. I don't wait for that minute, I press-hold and send to myself via whatsapp. Airdrop is cool but I have to wait and whatsapp faster.
If you didn't know you could message yourself on whatsapp, let me tell you it's a fantastic way to keep documents, photos, texts easily available/browsable. country code + number all attached (this is also a way to message someone without saving the number) ''https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=''
Airdrop is too buggy with firewalls and Z

and God willing ill finish later.
