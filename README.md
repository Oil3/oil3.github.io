| `private var`    | A variable that is accessible only within the scope of the enclosing declaration, such as a class or struct.                              |
| `fileprivate var`| A variable that is accessible within the same source file.                                                                                |
| `internal var`   | A variable that has internal access (default access level), meaning it's accessible within the same module.                               |
| `public var`     | A variable that is accessible from any file within the same module and from any module that imports the module where the variable is defined. |
| `open var`       | Similar to `public var`, but it also allows the variable to be overridden by subclasses outside the module.                              |
| `var`            | A variable that can be read and written to. It has internal access by default.                                                            |
| `let`            | A constant that is assigned a value only once and cannot be changed after it's set.                                                       |
| `weak var`       | A variable with a weak reference to an object. It's used to prevent strong reference cycles in closures and between class instances.     |
| `static var`     | A variable that is shared among all instances of a class or struct. It belongs to the type itself rather than any instance.               |
| `class var`      | Similar to `static var`, but it allows subclasses to override the variable's value.                                                      |
